The original idea for the project was scrapped very late into my time coding, so the final result is unfortunately just an extensively simplified version of the inteneded result
Although it doesn't meet everything, it is a fine blueprint to build off of fand actually attain a  satisfying result. 
The original file was supposed to be a bit more dynamic, allowing you input the learner's ID and accesing the data from there on, however the final result, while it still mostly does that
is just a bit more strict and way less dynamic as the way it is now you can't add more data ( which is how I wanted to implement it - so that you could add more data for the program to sort through)
with that said I'm still proud of the result, I just wish I read a little more carefully.
